1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
I see you're working on a new look.

2
00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:06,000
My guess is the I <3 Java t-shirt is meant to be ironic.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,700
Doctor, I'm recreating myself as a swash-buckling hacker slavant with a darkside

4
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:17,000
who is actually a nice guy underneight once you crack his world-be-damned nonchalants

5
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:21,000
Have you adopted a programming lanaguage to match your new persona?

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,200
I haven't decided, but erlang is the front runner

7
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:26,000
Why not closure?

8
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:27,600
Oh please

9
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,700
Let's talk about another work experience the affected you

10
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:37,100
Well, like most software companies we went through an outsourcing phase

11
00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:40,000
when our new CTO came on board

12
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,400
He immediately handed our most imporant development initiative

13
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:46,350
over to a totally unproven team offshore

14
00:00:46,350 --> 00:00:049,100
just because his buddy got him a really good price

15
00:00:049,100 --> 00:00:53,800
the prospect of nearly doubling the size of his organization at such a cut rate

16
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:56,000
was simply more than he could resist

17
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:59,200
I see many patients who lost jobs to outsourcing

18
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:03,200
My team oversaw the work and prior to the kick off meeting

19
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:07,800
we received a lecture on how the offshore team was very sensitive to critism

20
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:11,000
and that we had to make sure that no one lost face

21
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:14,200
Mainaining face is very important in many cultures

22
00:01:14,300 --> 00:01:18,000
In software culture maintaining face is not hard

23
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:20,000
it's actually very simple

24
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:24,200
the rule of thumb is don't formally submit code that looks like

25
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:28,000
it was written by two cats copulating on top of a keyboard

26
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
i mean holy crist

27
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,400
we would review their code when we got into the office and

28
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:38,400
once we stopped laughing and pissing ourselves and regained some composure

29
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:42,200
we sat around and tried to figure out how we could tell these imbiciles that

30
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:45,900
their code sucked balls without hurting their precious feelings

31
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:49,000
Providing constructive feedback is always challenging

32
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:53,000
For fucks sake, the only thing constructive that we could have done

33
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:57,100
was to use their source files as random keys for ssl certs

34
00:01:57,100 --> 00:02:01,600
We ended up rewriting their code and commiting it back under their account

35
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:06,800
They'd pick up the next day totally oblivious to that fact that the code changed

36
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:09,200
was legible and actually worked

37
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:13,000
This happened again and again until the project was completed

38
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:14,500
What happened

39
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:19,400
The CTO was so happy with the work that he transferred all development offshore

40
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:21,800
and then he fired my team

41
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,400
But you were the reason the project was successful

42
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:29,200
I was honored to be part of the one of the universes great pound you in the ass ironies

43
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:34,800
In the end they never shipped another line of code and the company went out of business

44
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:39,900
When they found out who wrote the original code, they blamed my team for everything

45
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:44,600
The CTO was celebrated as a genius tactician of start up efficiency and

46
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:47,400
appointed by the VC to another happless company

47
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:50,100
You can read about it in the tech crunch deadpool.

48
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:52,200
That CTO is a total douchebag

49
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:54,000
The man was,

50
00:02:54,100 --> 00:02:58,600
um I'm not actually sure there's a word to describe this man

51
00:02:58,700 --> 00:03:02,500
It's a combination of extreme arrogance and utter stupidity

52
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:06,400
"douch-baggery" is close, but it's not what i'm looking for

53
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:10,400
What you're describing on one hand is classic narcissism

54
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:14,100
The first sign is an exagerated sense of self-importance

55
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:16,000
Did you observe this?

56
00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:17,800
On a daily basis.

57
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:23,200
What about a procupation with fantasies of unlimited success, power, or briliance?

58
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:24,900
All of the fucking time.

59
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:27,400
Requires eccessive admiration

60
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:28,700
Constantly

61
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:30,600
Has a sense of entitlement

62
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:32,000
Overwelmingly

63
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:37,700
Show arrogant, haughty, patronizing or conteptuous behaviours or attitudes

64
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:40,400
My god, there's a name for this?

65
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:43,400
It's called "Narcissistic Personality Disorder"

66
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:48,200
Holy shit, but there's still and element that I'm struggling to describe

67
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:51,000
it's almost as if he is mentally retarded

68
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:55,500
Metal retardation amoung senior management in most companies is quite rare

69
00:03:55,600 --> 00:04:02,000
I'm no expert, but this man exhibited classic retard behavior in every meeting i saw him in

70
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:07,000
if after one of his self absorbed overatories he would return to his chair and

71
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,700
drool coffee on to his shirt while making fart noises with his mouth

72
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:13,100
no one would give it a second thought

73
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:19,400
Docter i believe has has full blown Narcissistic Metal Retardation Disorder

74
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:22,000
That's not a real condition

75
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:25,600
I can't thank you enough for helping me work through this

76
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:30,000
it's so liberating to know that my tortured existence under the leadership

77
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:35,000
of this shit-for-brains was no more an injustice than catching a cold from a random sneeze

78
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:37,400
had i only known at the time

79
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:42,800
Narcissistic mental retardation disorder, it makes perfect sense

80
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:48,600
He has Narcissistic, Mental, Retardation Disorder

81
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:51,450
I see our time is up

82
00:04:52,050 --> 00:04:53,800
This has been produtive
