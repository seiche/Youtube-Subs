00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
I see you're working on a new look.

00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:06,000
My guess is the I <3 Java t-shirt is meant to be ironic.

00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,700
Doctor, I'm recreating myself as a swash-buckling hacker slavant with a darkside

00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:17,000
who is actually a nice guy underneight once you crack his world-be-damned nonchalants

00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:21,000
Have you adopted a programming lanaguage to match your new persona?

00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,200
I haven't decided, but erlang is the front runner

00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:26,000
Why not closure?

00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:27,600
Oh please

00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,700
Let's talk about another work experience the affected you

00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:37,100
Well, like most software companies we went through an outsourcing phase

00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:40,000
when our new CTO came on board

00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,400
He immediately handed our most imporant development initiative

00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:46,350
over to a totally unproven team offshore

00:00:46,350 --> 00:00:049,100
just because his buddy got him a really good price

00:00:049,100 --> 00:00:53,800
the prospect of nearly doubling the size of his organization at such a cut rate

00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:56,000
was simply more than he could resist

00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:59,200
I see many patients who lost jobs to outsourcing

00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:03,200
My team oversaw the work and prior to the kick off meeting

00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:07,800
we received a lecture on how the offshore team was very sensitive to critism

00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:11,000
and that we had to make sure that no one lost face

00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:14,200
Mainaining face is very important in many cultures

00:01:14,300 --> 00:01:18,000
In software culture maintaining face is not hard

00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:20,000
it's actually very simple

00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:24,200
the rule of thumb is don't formally submit code that looks like

00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:28,000
it was written by two cats copulating on top of a keyboard

00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
i mean holy crist

00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,400
we would review their code when we got into the office and

00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:38,400
once we stopped laughing and pissing ourselves and regained some composure

00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:42,200
we sat around and tried to figure out how we could tell these imbiciles that

00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:45,900
their code sucked balls without hurting their precious feelings

00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:49,000
Providing constructive feedback is always challenging

00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:53,000
For fucks sake, the only thing constructive that we could have done

00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:57,100
was to use their source files as random keys for ssl certs

00:01:57,100 --> 00:02:01,600
We ended up rewriting their code and commiting it back under their account

00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
They'd pick up the next day totally oblivious to that fact that the code changed

00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
was legible and actually worked

00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
This happened again and again until the project was completed

00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What happened

00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The CTO was so happy with the work that he transferred all development offshore

00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
and then he fired my team

00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
But you were the reason the project was successful

00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I was honored to be part of the one of the universes great pound you in the ass ironies

00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
In the end they never shipped another line of code and the company went out of business

00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
When they found out who wrote the original code, they blamed my team for everything

00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The CTO was celebrated as a genius tactician of start up efficiency and

00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
appointed by the VC to another happless company

00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
You can read about it in the tech crunch deadpool.

00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That CTO is a total douchebag

00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The man was,

00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
um I'm not actually sure there's a word to describe this man

00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's a combination of extreme arrogance and utter stupidity

00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
"douch-baggery" is close, but it's not what i'm looking for

00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What you're describing on one hand is classic narcissism

00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
The first sign is an exagerated sense of self-importance

00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Did you observe this?

00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
On a daily basis.

00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
What about a procupation with fantasies of unlimited success, power, or briliance?

00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
All of the fucking time.

00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Requires eccessive admiration

00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Constantly

00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Has a sense of entitlement

00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Overwelmingly

00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Show arrogant, haughty, patronizing or conteptuous behaviours or attitudes

00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
My god, there's a name for this?

00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
It's called "Narcissistic Personality Disorder"

00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Holy shit, but there's still and element that I'm struggling to describe

00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
it's almost as if he is mentally retarded

00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Metal retardation amoung senior management in most companies is quite rare

00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm no expert, but this man exhibited classic retard behavior

00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
in every meeting i saw him in

00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
if after one of his self absorbed overatories he would return to his chain and

00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
drool coffee on to his shirt while making fart noises with his mouth

00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
no one would give it a second thought

00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Docter i believe has has full blown

00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Narcissistic Metal Retardation Disorder

00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
That's not a real condition

00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I can't thank you enough for helping me work through this

00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
it's so liberating to know that my tortured existence under the leadership

00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
of this shit-for-brains was no more an injustice than catching a cold

00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
from a random sneeze had i only known at the time

00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Narcissistic mental retardation disorder, it makes perfect sense

00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
He is Narcissistic, Mental, Retardation Disorder

00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
I see our time is up

00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
This has been produtive
