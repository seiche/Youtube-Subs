1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:01,000
Good afternoon

2
00:00:01,200 --> 00:00:07,000
As the receptionist may have explained to you, we provide an initial 15 minute consultation,

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,800
after which we charge for each session.

4
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:11,400
What would you like to talk about?

5
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:15,800
Doctor, my life isn't exactly what I'd like it to be right now.

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,200
I just spent 6 months in the hospital recovering from

7
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:24,200
severe head trauma and parasitic infection that I contracted while working a farm.

8
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:27,000
My god. What happened?

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,600
I'd rather not get into the details.

10
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:31,200
Yes,  certainty.

11
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:35,200
As you can imagine 6 months in a hospital bed is a long time

12
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:39,000
and it provides plenty of opportunities to contemplate life.

13
00:00:39,100 --> 00:00:44,200
Meaning, why we're here. I thought working on a farm would help me clear my head

14
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:47,200
get a handle on what I was doing with my life.

15
00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:51,000
I had some issues with people in my profession and it wasn't healthy

16
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:53,300
That's an important realization.

17
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:59,200
I needed to face the fact that the work I really love to do is being overrun by retarded monkeys

18
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:01,400
Retarded monkeys?

19
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:03,600
That's a very strong statement.

20
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:08,300
I used to get mad when I was asked to do stupid things by stupid people.

21
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:13,200
I fought back, then I only realized that it made my life worse.

22
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:19,000
Then I gave in, then I became homicidal. Then I became suicidal.

23
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:24,600
Then I saw what those guys at AMC are doing and I thought maybe life isn't so bad.

24
00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:29,800
I mean, have you seen "Breaking Bad"? Talk about artistic integrity.

25
00:01:29,900 --> 00:01:32,200
Holy shit that show is fantastic.

26
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:36,100
Tell me about something that affected you and your work prior to the farm.

27
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:40,800
Well, I was lead developer on a web application for a start up.

28
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:45,600
We chose PHP because it is the obvious choice for web development.

29
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:49,600
It is tightly integrated with Apache, scales marvelously,

30
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:53,800
and it's easy to find solid developers who know what the hell they are doing.

31
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:58,200
If you throw a dollar to the wall full of the top websites around the world,

32
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:01,600
chances are excellent you'd hit one using PHP.

33
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:05,000
I don't know what that means, but please go on.

34
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:07,400
The project was a huge success,

35
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:11,600
we finished on time and the site held up to the company's steady growth.

36
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:13,200
It all worked.

37
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:16,700
I mean, my god, it all worked so very well.

38
00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:18,150
What happened?

39
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:21,200
Our company's VC brought in a new CTO.

40
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:24,400
He said we need to modernize our architecture.

41
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:29,300
He said the PHP reeked of the nineties and that Ruby was the new web language.

42
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:33,600
Doctor I swear to god I'm not making this shit up.

43
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:37,400
He said, honest to Christ, he said and I quote,

44
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:40,400
"Ruby is what all of the cool kids are using".

45
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:44,600
I had an honest to god brain aneurysm right there in the meeting.

46
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:51,400
I just sat and twitched in my chair, people finally called 911 after I vomited on the table.

47
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:52,800
That's incredible.

48
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:56,250
All of a sudden our team was crawling with Bohemian Ruby hipsters

49
00:02:56,250 --> 00:02:59,400
with their Macintosh laptops and hemp satchels.

50
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:02,400
They sat around like first century Greek philosophers

51
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:08,400
considering the esthetic value of placing control statements before or after a block.

52
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:11,600
When I showed them our finally tuned SQL

53
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:14,600
which had been running in production for 3 months

54
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:19,600
They said that in the modern world databases go away and people work with model classes

55
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:24,300
They said that no one in their right mind would ever work directly with SQL because

56
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:29,800
objection relation mappers are so optimized that you'd be a fool to use anything else.

57
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:32,400
then they pretended to get a phone call

58
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:36,300
they said it was the eighties it wanted its Emacs editor back.

59
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:38,200
What is Emacs?

60
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:42,000
Oh god, never ask that question of an Emacs user.

61
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:44,200
What happened with your project?

62
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:46,400
We entered the ranks of the cool kids

63
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:50,400
our response time went from 300 milliseconds under PHP

64
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:55,000
to 3 seconds under Ruby, that's a ten fold increase.

65
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,600
The site had multi-hour outages.

66
00:03:57,600 --> 00:04:02,100
It didn't matter though, because we had an architecture we could blog about.

67
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:07,000
When you're a cool kid everyone wants to know how you managed to make Ruby scale.

68
00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:12,800
So you write about how you managed to use Redis and Tokyo Cabinet to solve your self inflicted problems

69
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:18,400
of storing user sessions in a high latency database like it's a big fucking revelation.

70
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:24,000
Weren't your users a little pissed that the site became so slow and was down for so long?

71
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,400
What do users have to do with making art?

72
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:32,600
Sure we lost paying customers because our website ran like a flaming pile of cat crap.

73
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:38,300
But when you look past the outages and consider the beauty of our finely crafted Ruby source code

74
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:44,000
you weep, openly for joy, and thank god that you work among poets.

75
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
It does sound rather romantic.

76
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Tell me more about these Bohemians.

77
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:53,400
For fucks sake, they think it's 1963 Greenwich village.

78
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:58,800
They would come to the office with one or two groupies just hanging out watching them work.

79
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,000
How the hell do software developers get groupies?

80
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,800
You never see PHP developers with groupies.

81
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:10,500
PHP developers are too busy building websites that actually work.

82
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:14,400
Have you considered that you maybe jealous of Ruby developers?

83
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:17,800
Fuck Ruby.

84
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:22,800
Fuck the poet philosophers with the gorgeous web applications and their groupies

85
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:25,800
and their amazing launch parties with pretty girls.

86
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,800
I'm afraid we our out of time.

87
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:36,100
Given your rather extreme case, I'd like to see you twice a week,

88
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:38,200
if that works for your schedule.
