Good afternoon

As the receptionist may have explained to you,

We provide an initial 15 minute consultation, afterwhich we charge for each session.

What would you like to talk about?

Docter, my life isn't exactly what i'd like it to be right now.

I just spent 6 months in the hospital recovering from 

severe head trama and parasitic infection that i contracted while working a farm

My god. What happened?

I'd rather not get into the details.

Yes, certaintly.

As you can imagine 6 months in a hospital bed is a long time 

and it provides plenty of oppertunities to contemplate life

Meaning, why we're here i thought working on a farm would help me clear my head

get a handle on what i was doing with my life.

I had some issues with people in my profession and it wasn't healthy

That's an important realization. 

I needed to face the fact that the work i really love to do is being overrun by retarded monkies

Retarded monkies?

That's a very strong statement

I used to get mad when I was asked to do stupid things by stupid people. 

I fought back, then I only realized that it made my life worse.

Then I gave in, then I became homicidle. Then I became suicidal.

Then I saw what those guys at AMC are doing and I thought maybe life isn't so bad.

I mean, have you seen "Breaking Bad"? Talk about artistic integrity. 

Holy shit that show is fantastic.

Tell me about something that affected you and your work prior to the farm.

Well, I was lead developer on a web application for a start up.

We chose PHP because it is the obvious choice for web development. 

It is tightly integrated with Apache, scales mavelously, and it's easy to find solid developers who know what the hell they are doing.

If you throw a dart to a wall full of the top websites around the world,

chances are excelent you'd hit one using PHP

I don't know what that means, but please go on.

The project was a huge success, we finished on time and the site held up to the company's steady growth

It all worked.

I mean, my god, it all worked so very well. 

What happened?

Our company's VC brought in a new CTO

He said we need to modernize our architecture, he said the PHP reeked of the nineties and that Ruby was the new web language

Docter I swaer to god I'm not making this shit up

He said, honest to crist, he said and i quote, "Ruby is what all of the cool kids are using"

I had an honest to god brain anyuerism right there in the meeting

I just sat and twitched in my chair, people finaly called 911 after i vomited on the table

That's incredible

All of a sudden our team was crawling with Bohemian ruby hipsters with their macintosh laptops and sachels

They sat around like first century greek philosophers considering the astetic value of placing control statements before or after a block

When I showed them our finally tuned SQL which had been running in production for 3 months,

they said that in the modern world databases go away and people work with model classes

they said that no one in their right mind would ever work directly with SQL because 

objection relation mappers are so optimized that you'd be a fool to use anything else

then they pretended to get a phone call, they said it was the eighties it wanted its emacs editor back

what is emacs?

Oh god, never ask that question of an emacs users

What happened with your project?

We entered the ranks of the cool kids, our response time went from 300 milliseconds under PHP

to 3 seconds under Ruby, that's a ten fold increase

the site had multihour outages

it didn't matter because we had an architecture we could blog about 

when you're a cool kid everyone wants to know how you managed to make ruby scale 

so you write about how you managed to use Redis and Tokyo Cabinet to solve your self inflicted problems

of storing user sessions in a high latency database like it's a big fucking revelation

weren't your users a little pissed that the site became so slow and was down for so long?

What do users have to do with making art?

Sure we lost paying customers because our website ran like a flaming pile of cat crap

but when you look past the outages and consider the beauty of our finely crafted ruby source code

you weep, openly for joy and thank god that you work amoung poets

it does sound rather romantic

tell me more about these bohemians

for fucks sake, they think it's 1963 grennich village 

they would ocme to the office with one or two groupies just hanging out watching them work

how the hell do software developers get groupies?

You never see PHP developers with groupies

PHP developers are too busy building websites that actually work

Have you considerred that you maybe jelous of ruby developers?

Fuck Ruby

Fuck the poet philosophers with the gorgeious web applications and their groupies

and their amazing launch parties with pretty girls

I'm afraid we our out of time

Given your rather extreme case, I'd like to see you twice a week, if that works for your schedule.
